    <h2>About Me</h2>                
    <p>
    Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Jake Preciado, a passionate learner on the journey to becoming a full stack web engineer. 
    This space is dedicated to showcasing my evolving skills and experiences in the world of web development.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the ever-evolving field of web development, I find joy in crafting seamless and visually appealing digital 
    experiences. From front-end aesthetics to back-end functionality, each line of code represents a step closer to my goal 
    of creating impactful and user-friendly websites.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of coding, you'll often find me outdoors with my camera or drone, capturing the world around me. And 
    when I'm not doing that, I'm jamming on my guitar, creating music that brings a little extra joy to my day.
